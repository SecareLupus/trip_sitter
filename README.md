# trip_sitter

A harm reduction tool for tracking substance consumption and experience notes over the course of personal investigation.

Features Implemented:
* Autocomplete substances from PsyconautWiki Substance list.
* Tracks a 'trip' with substances, doses, and experience notes stored together, each timestamped independently.
* Separates archived trips from the current trip.
* Free and Open Source, no advertisements, no microtransactions.

Future features I'd like to add:
* Substance awareness - ability to use PsyconautWiki data to provide helpful information like expected duration, safe dosages, and potential drug interactions.
* Planning mode - ability to create a plan for a trip, allowing for warnings to be shown if you decide to exceed your plans or add unplanned substances, also provide timers for planning bumps.
* Safety Reminders - ability to cast calm, helpful messages to local chromecast devices, either reminders of what the person has consumed, or summary of the current state, etc.
* Set & Setting Media - links to calming media to help maintain positive set and setting, particularly for psychedelics.
* Safety Buddy - Provide contact information for a trusted friend, if your experience is not going well, allow for a quick and easy messaging of the current triplog to the trusted friend, with indication of what sort of help is desired.
* Other moonshot ideas are out there if there's enough interest to allow for it.
